# Water Container Problem

This project provides a solution to the classic water container problem, which calculates the units of water trapped between blocks of varying heights. The solution is implemented as a web application using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS 

## Problem Description

Given an array n (with values always greater than -1), representing the heights of blocks, the application computes and displays the number of water units that can be stored between the blocks. 

For example:
 
 - Input: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 4, 0]

 - Output: 18 units of water.
